## A Video Game Based Database

The domain of the application that we are creating will be gaming. It will be a video game where players will be able to choose one of the available 
missions to complete with the help of an NPC Ally that they themselves get to choose. The team will be able to fight multiple battles against multiple enemies 
in different areas of the map. They will be able to get rewards after each battle. In the end, the player record will be stored in a database. 

The PlayerRecord will store the total points that the player has earned on their missions so far, which determines their overall ranking. It also stores the data for 
each mission, which includes the completion status and attempt history. The stats for each attempt at a Mission is added to that Mission's attempt history. In 
addition, the attempt history for each area is also included in an attempt of a Mission.
